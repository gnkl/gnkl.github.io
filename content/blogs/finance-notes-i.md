## Interest rates and Inflation

* Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises.
* Interest rates (usually set by a country’s central bank) represent the cost of borrowing money.

* When inflation is high, central banks raise interest rates to cool down the economy.
* When inflation is low, central banks lower interest rates to encourage spending and investment.

* When we talk about interest rates, we mainly refer to the central bank rate (Fed Funds Rate in the US, ECB rate in Eurozone, etc.). This is the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight. Changes in this rate propagate and influence other interest rates in the economy (e.g., mortgage rates, business loans, savings rates).

How Higher Interest Rates Affect Inflation:
* Borrowing becomes more expensive: Consumers and businesses take out fewer loans (for homes, cars, expansion).
* Spending decreases: With higher borrowing costs and more attractive savings rates, demand for goods and services falls.
* Slower demand growth reduces upward pressure on prices, which can help bring inflation down.

How Lower Interest Rates Affect Inflation:
* Borrowing becomes cheaper: Encourages consumers and businesses to take loans and spend more.
* Increased demand: More consumption and investment can push prices up.
* Inflation rises if the economy overheats and supply cannot keep up with demand.

The Time Lag:
* The effect of interest rate changes on inflation is not immediate. It can take 6–18 months for changes to fully work through the economy.


> I would also think that higher interest rates would decrease loans for companies and would reduce supply, leading to higher prices. But in reality, the drop in demand has a stronger effect (dominates) on prices than supply, so the net effect of higher interest rates is lower inflation.

Note:
* In cases of supply-driven inflation (e.g., oil shocks, food shortages, supply chain disruptions), raising rates doesn’t directly solve the supply problem. It only works by suppressing demand to “match” the reduced supply.
* Stagflation (high inflation + weak growth) is so painful: higher rates hurt growth further, but doing nothing lets inflation persist.

## Interest rates and how it affects Bond Prices and Yields

Bond Basics:
* A bond is essentially a loan.
* The bondholder (you, the investor) lends money to the bondissuer (a government or company).
* The amount is called face value, par value or principal. You get paid the amount back at maturity (the bond’s end date).
* The bondholder receives interest payments called coupons periodically (e.g., annually or semi-annually). The coupon is paid to compensate the bondholder/investor for time and risk of the loan. The interest payment is what makes bonds attractive to investors.
* Remember the time value of money: a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future, due to its potential earning capacity. Also, inflation reduces it's purchasing power.
* The coupon rate is fixed when the bond is issued.
* The bond price (market price) is how much investors are willing to pay for the bond in the market (e.g. one year after the bond was issued, investors may want to pay more/less than the original face value).
* The price may be: At par (price = face value), Above par (premium, price > face value), Below par (discount, price < face value).
* The yield is the return an investor earns from the bond, expressed as a percentage. Unlike the coupon rate, the yield takes into account the price you paid for the bond.
* Yield: If the bond market price falls, an investor can buy it and receive the same coupon payments by paying less. Therefore, the yield is higher than the coupon rate (buys the bond at discount/below par).
* Yield: conversly, if the bond market price rises, the yield is lower than the coupon rate (buys the bond at premium/above par).
* Bonds provide predictable income (important for investors like retirees, pension funds).


How Interest Rates Affect Bond Prices:

* When an issuer (government or company) sells a new bond, it must offer a coupon rate that appeals to investors given current market interest rates. (also because of competition with other bonds).
* Think of the following example:
    * You bought a bond yesterday, with `Face value = $1,000` and `Coupon rate = 5%`. Therefore, the `Annual coupon = $50`.
    * Now suppose market interest rates rise to 6%. To be competitive, the `new coupon rate = 6%` for bonds with `Face value = $1,000`. Therefore, the `new annual coupon = $60`.
    * Your bond that pays $50 is less attractive than the new bond that pays $60. To sell it, you must lower the price until the yield matches the new market rate.
    * So now the market value of your bond will fall below $1,000 (below par) until the `yield = 6%` (the actual  depends on how long the maturity is).
* In a nutshell, when interest rates rise -> bond prices fall. (interest rates rise -> new bonds have higher coupons/yields -> existing bonds are less attractive and must adjust their yields -> their prices fall).
* In contrast, when interest rates fall -> bond prices rise. (interest rates fall -> new bonds have lower coupons/yields -> existing bonds are more attractive and can adjust their yields -> their prices rise).
